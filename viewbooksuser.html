                <h2>Tabassum Ka Iqbal </h2>
                <p>Author: turab </p>
                <p>Description: 
Iqbal and Tabassum are the best of friends. The folly of youth makes them see each other in ways different from what their families intend for them, and their choices are disregarded no matter how much they try. Iqbal and Tabassum make difficult choices to let go of their own desires in the larger scheme of things.
Life comes a full circle with time, and the house of cards that once stood upright is restacked after a round of shuffling.
