          <h2>Encyclopedia Brown, Boy Detective</h2>
          <p>Author: By Donald J. Sobol</p>
          <p>Award: Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America</p>
          <p>
            Description: Leroy Brown, aka Encyclopedia Brown, is Idaville
            neighborhood’s ten-year-old star detective. With an uncanny knack
            for trivia, he solves mysteries for the neighborhood kids through
            his own detective agency. But his dad also happens to be the chief
            of the Idaville police department, and every night around the dinner
            table, Encyclopedia helps him solve his most baffling crimes. And
            with ten confounding mysteries in each book, not only does
            Encyclopedia have a chance to solve them, but the reader is given
            all the clues as well. Interactive and chock full of interesting
            bits of information—it’s classic Encyclopedia Brown!

          <h2>Friendship According to Humphrey</h2>
          <p>Author: By Betty G. Birney</p>
          <p>Award: Emmy, three Humanitas</p>
          <p>
            Description:The second book in the beloved and award-winning school
            hamster series! After the holidays, Humphrey is shocked by a big
            surprise in Room 26-a new class pet! Humphrey tries to be welcoming,
            but Og the frog doesn’t respond to any of his friendly squeaks or
            visits (remember, he has a lock-that-doesn’t-lock). Plus, the
            students are so interested in Og, they almost stop paying attention
            to Humphrey altogether. Humphrey doesn’t like the mad-bad-sad
            feelings he’s had since Og came, but luckily he still gets to have
            adventures with different kids on the weekends. Friendship can be
            tricky, but Humphrey is an intrepid problem-solver. If any hamster
            can become buddies with a frog, he can.

          <h2>When Breath Becomes Air</h2>
          <p>Author: By Paul Kalanithi</p>
          <p>Award: the American Academy of Neurological Surgery’s</p>
          <p>
            Description:When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. Kalanithi’s
            brave memoir chronicles in exquisite prose his brave battle with
            terminal illness, but rather than verge into depressing territory,
            it is a triumphant and inspiring read. His words make one rethink
            our perception of time—to not only imagine what we might achieve in
            the future, but to cherish the beauty that surrounds us in the
            present.” —Alyson Richman, author of The Velvet Hours

          <h2>The Phantom Tollbooth</h2>
          <p>Author: By Norton Juster , Illustrated by Jules Feiffer</p>
          <p>Award: Obie Award</p>
          <p>
            Description: In fifth grade, I received The Phantom Tollbooth by
            Norton Juster and spent the next three days wrapped up in the pages,
            unable to put it down. It was the first book that grabbed hold of me
            and didn’t let go. When I was a fifth grade teacher, I would read it
            aloud to my students every year and watch as the story of Milo and
            the mysterious Tollbooth grabbed them the way it grabbed me when I
            was that age. I still have that same weather-worn copy on my book
            shelf and look forward to the day I can hand it off to my son.”
